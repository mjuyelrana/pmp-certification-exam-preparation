### Effectively engage with stakeholders
**STAKEHOLDERS**
- Engage stakeholders proactively and to the point needed to contribute to project success and customer satisfaction. 
- Stakeholders impact projects, performance, and outcomes. 
- Project teams work for other stakeholders by engaging with them. 
- Stakeholder engagement proactively improves value delivery. 

**Stakeholders can affect many aspects of a project, including but not limited to:**
- Scope/ Requirements
- Schedule 
- Cost 
- Project Team 
- Plans 
- Outcomes 
- Culture
- Benefits realization 
- Risk 
- Quality 
- Success 

- Identifying, analyzing, and proactively engaging with stakeholders from the start to the end of the project.
- Project teams are a group of stakeholders. 
- Consist of defining how, when, how often and under what situations stakeholders want to be and should be engaged. 
- This relies on interpersonal skills, including taking initiative, integrity, honesty, collaboration, respect, empathy, and confidence. 
- Engagement helps project teams detect, collect, and evaluate information, data, and opinions. 
- Project teams actively engage other stackeholders throughout the project to minimize potential enegatibe impacts and maximize positive impacts. 

### Focus on value 
**VALUE**
- Continually evaluate and adjust project alignment to business objectives and intended benefits and value.
- value is the ultimate indicator of project success. 
- Value can be realized throughout the project, at the end of the project, or after the project is complete. 
- value, and the benefits that contribute to value can be defined in quantitative and/or qualitative terms.
- A focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the intended benefits that lead to value creation.
- Project teams evaluate progress and adapt to maximize the expected value. 
- Includes outcomes from the perspective of the customer or end user is the ultimate success indicator and driver of projects.
- A business case contains at least these supporting and interrelated elements:
  - Business need 
  - Project justification 
  - Business strategy 
- Value is the worth, importance or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, i the sense that the same concept can have different values for different people and organizations. 
- To support value realization from projects, project teams shift focus from deliverables to the intended outcomes. Doing so allows project teams to deliver on the vision or purpose of the project, rather than simply creating a specific deliverable. 

### Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions 
**SYSTEM THINKING**
- A system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole. 
- A project is a system of interdependent and interacting domains of activity. 
- Recognize, evaluate, and respond to the dynamic circumstances within and surrounding the project in a holistic way to posituvely affect project performance. 
- Systems thinking entails taking a holistic view of  how project parts interact with each other and with external systems. 
- Systems are constantly changing, requiring consistent attention to internal and external conditions.
- Being responsive to system interactions allows project teams to leverage positive outcomes. 
- Project teams should acknowledge this holistic view of a project, seeing the project as a system with its own working parts. 
- A project works within other larger systems, and a project deliverable may become part of a larger system to realize benefits.
- As projects unfold, internal and external conditions are continuously changing. A single change can create several impacts. 
- Systems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system.
- The project system often brings together a diverse project team engaged in working for a common objective.

- By mising styles and leveraging motivators, any project team member or stakeholder can motivate or influence and in tuen grow the project team, regardless of role or position. 

### Tailor based on context
Each project is unique.
- Design the project development methods based on the needs of the project and its objectives, stakeholders, governance and the environment.
- Using "just enough" process to accomplish the desired outcome while maximizing value, managing cost, and enhancing speed. 
- Project success is based on adapting to unique context of the project. 
- tailpring the method is iterative and therefore is a continuous process throughout the project. 
- Project teams tailor the proper framework that will enable the flexibility to consistently produce positive outcomes. 
- Project teams discuss and decide on the delivery approach and resources on a project-by-project basis.

- Complexity can be introduced by events or conditions.
- Project teams can stay vigilant in identifying elements of complexity and use a veriety of methods to reduce the amount or impact of complexity. 

**Some of the more common source of complexity are:**
- Human behavior
- System behavior 
- Uncertainty and ambiguity
- Technological innovation 
Being vigilant for indications of complexity allows project teams to adapt their approaches and plans to navigate potential disruption to effective project delivery.

### Optimize risk responses 
- A risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on one or more objectives.
- Risks can be positive (opportunities) or negative (threats).
- Project teams seek to maximize positive risks (opportunities) and decrease exposure to negative risks (threats).
- Constantly evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project and its outcomes. 
- Risks are addressed continually throughout the project.
- Risk responses should be:
  - Appropriate for the significance of the risk.
  - Cost effective.
  - Realistic within the project context. 
  - Agreed to by relevant stakeholders and 
  - Owned by a responsible person. 
- Project team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds.
- An organization's risk attitude, appetite and threshold influence how risk is addressed.

- Adaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.
- Resiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to recover quickly from a setback or failure. 
- Buld adaptability and resiliency into organization's and project team's approaches.
- A focus on outcomes rather than outputs facilitates adaptability. 
- A project rarely performs exactly as initially planned. 
- Projects are influenced by internal and external factors-new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, among other factors-which exist in a system of interactions. 

**In a project environment, capabilities that support adaptability and resilience include:**
- Short feedback loops to adapt quickly 
- Continuous learning and improvement.
- Regular inspection and adaptation 
- Open and transparent planning that engages stakeholders. 
- Small-scale prototypes and experiments 
- Open organizational conersations 
- Diverse project teams with broad skill sets, cultures and experience.
- Understanding from past learning. 
- Building adaptability and resiliency in a project keeps project teams on track to the desired outcome when internal and external factors change, and it helps them recover from setbacks. 
- These features also help project teams learn and improve so that hey can quickly recover from failures or setbacks and continure making progress toward delivering value. 

### Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state 
**CHANGE** 
- Prepare those impacted for the acceptance to go from the current state to the intended future state created by the project output. 
- A structured approach will helps individuals, groups and the organization transition from the current state to a future desired state. 
- Change can originate from internal influences or external sources. 
- Enabling change can be challenging as not as all stakeholders embrace change.
- Attempting too much change in a short time can lead to change fatigue and/or resistance.
- Stakeholder engagement and motivational approaches assist in change adoption.
- Remaining relevant in today's business environment is a fundamental challenge for all organizations. 
- Effective change management uses a motivational strategy rather than a forceful one. 
- Knowing and addressing the needs of stakeholders to embrace change throughout the project life cycle helps to integrate the resulting change in the project work, making a successful outcome more likely.
